# Custom CNN-ViT & CNN for seizure detection using ECG Spectrograms (Reusable for Image Classification)

This repository contains **my custom-designed CNN-ViT and CNN architectures** for detecting seizures from ECG spectrograms.  
While designed for ECG data, the models are **fully adaptable for other image classification tasks**, making them reusable beyond this project.


CNN-ViT architecture is illustrated below:

CNN architecture is illustrated below:
